ncurses-rs ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jeaye/ncurses-rs.png)
==========

This is a very thin wrapper around the ncurses TUI lib.

## Building
The compiled library will go to the `target` directory.
```
make clean && make
```

## Examples
Examples are built automagically. To run them, check the `bin`
directory. Example numbers increase along with the complexity
of the example.

Current examples:  
**1.** [Hello World](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs/blob/master/examples/ex_1.rs)  
**2.** [Basic Input & Attributes](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs/blob/master/examples/ex_2.rs)  
**3.** [Simple Pager](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs/blob/master/examples/ex_3.rs)  
**4.** [Window Movement](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs/blob/master/examples/ex_4.rs)  
**5.** [Pager & Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs/blob/master/examples/ex_5.rs)
